This edition includes a new Suggestions for Further Reading by Jennifer Buehler. At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate. This far from civilization they can do anything they want. Anything. But as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far removed from reality as the hope of being rescued.",

Maupin deftly illustrates how far America and the pioneering Anna have come, and nearly forty years into the series, his writing remains wildly addictive but is deeper and richer.”—People The last three novels of Armistead Maupin’s bestselling, critically-acclaimed Tales of the City are now available for the first time as an omnibus edition. The epic series, published between 1978 and 2014, spans the decade before the AIDS crisis through the era of marriage equality following an unforgettable set of characters, whose diverse sexual identities helped set the social stage for the ongoing sexual revolution. Goodbye Barbary Lane—comprised of Michael Tolliver Lives (2007), Mary Ann in Autumn (2010), and The Days of Anna Madrigal (2014)—brings closure to the lives and legacies of the characters through which generations have found connection to America’s larger cultural struggles over the past four decades. Joining two companion omnibus volumes, 28 Barbary Lane and Back to Barbary Lane, Goodbye Barbary Lane presents all of “Mr. Maupin’s adeptness at fluid dialogue, his flair for shaping characters who thread the needle between pop archetypes and singular human beings, and his great gift for intricate if occasionally preposterous plotting”(New York Times).",

Banned by the Roman Catholic Church, the book gives an account of Defoe's beliefs of how the Devil has participated in world history, and is to blame for the Crusades. Defoe was a Presbyterian and in the book, he also discusses how the devil is close to the powers in the Catholic Church, which is probably the main reason it was banned by them. Over 22 chapters, the author writes about everything from the origin of the Devil, his expulsion from Heaven (along with explaining the 'inaccuracies' of Milton's Paradise Lost), the power of the Devil, his victory over Noah, his agents, his appearance, and, the tools he works with including magicians and fortune-tellers and the black arts in general. The Political History of the Devil is mentioned in George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss, as being a book belonging to Mr Tulliver. Full chapter list. № 77 in Anne Haight's List of Banned Books.",

Grab a cuppa, get settled in your favourite reading spot, and get acquainted with café owner Charlotte Denver, the well-meaning, but hilariously politically-incorrect members of her small-town community, and Pippin the dog. These clean, fun, cozy mysteries have plenty of recipes to try for yourself, but no gore, graphic language, sex or violence, and no pesky cliffhangers! Plenty of laughs, amateur sleuthing, and murder await in this four-book collection, set on England's beautiful Cornish coast, in the fictional town of St. Eves. TAPAS, CARROT CAKE AND A CORPSE - BOOK 1 Small-town murder was never so calculated... When a stranger is murdered, the residents of a close-knit community close ranks as the hunt for a killer gathers pace, and it's not long before inquisitive café owner Charlotte Denver is desperate for a return to carefree, small-town life. Determined to do whatever she can to see the killer behind bars, she starts poking around in things she shouldn't... and discovers a secret that rocks the bustling coastal town to its core. FUDGE CAKE, FELONY AND A FUNERAL - BOOK 2 Grief, greed and grudges - the perfect recipe for murder... As the townspeople bid a final goodbye to a much-loved member of the community, and relatives of the deceased arrive in St. Eves, it's not long before tempers flare as they become consumed by greed, intent to get their hands on the family fortune. When a body is discovered, will Charlotte find the vital clue to the killer's identity before anyone else is bumped off? SPARE RIBS, SECRETS AND A SCANDAL - BOOK 3 Sometimes it's the people you think you know best who are keeping the biggest secrets... As Charlotte prepares to move into her new home, life couldn't be sunnier. However, when old friends return to the town, tragedy follows close behind and it's not long before she finds herself trying to clear her best friend's name as long-hidden secrets and a scandal from years gone by are revealed. In a race against time to save a loved one, Charlotte needs every one of her amateur sleuthing skills as the story reaches it shocking climax. Will she be too late to save the day? PUMPKINS, PERIL AND A PAELLA - BOOK 4 A ghost from the past resurfaces at Halloween and Charlotte soon realises they'll stop at nothing to get what they want... When a dead body is discovered during the annual St. Eves' Halloween fair, it isn't long before Charlotte finds herself up to her neck in helping to solve another murder mystery. This one, however, proves to be a little too close to home for her liking as she finds herself, and the man she loves, in danger. With clues to find, a killer to catch and a wedding to organise, Charlotte has her work cut out.

This boxed set features New York Times bestselling author Julia Kent’s first three books in the series, starting with the prequel, Little Miss Perfect, which takes place ten years before Book 1, when Mallory Monahan and Will Lotham competed for valedictorian in high school. The nerd and the quarterback have a tantalizing encounter, but what happens when they meet ten years later is unbelievable… Which brings us to Fluffy — how Will and Mallory reconnect is a tale of mishaps, misunderstandings, and Mallory’s innocent mistake in thinking a job on Craigslist for a “fluffer” meant a house designer. Oops. This boxed set continues with Perky, another second-chance “do-over” for Persephone and Parker. Five years ago, he released very, very private photos that turned Perky into a social media sensation in the worst way possible. Hurt and betrayed, she’s blocked him from her life and her heart. But what if he didn’t do it? And surprise! He’s a member of Mallory and Will’s wedding party, too. Second chances and do-overs never felt so good… The Do-Over Boxed Set is a romantic comedy binge read.

The townspeople of Oran are in the grip of a deadly plague, which condemns its victims to a swift and horrifying death. Fear, isolation and claustrophobia follow as they are forced into quarantine. Each person responds in their own way to the lethal disease: some resign themselves to fate, some seek blame, and a few, like Dr. Rieux, resist the terror. An immediate triumph when it was published in 1947, The Plague is in part an allegory of France's suffering under the Nazi occupation, and a timeless story of bravery and determination against the precariousness of human existence.",

        "description": "A Small-Town Amateur Sleuth Mystery Romance Series Boxset This is a boxset of books 4-6 in The Father Tom Mysteries. Meet Father Tom Greer and Detective Helen Parr, former lovers reunited after twenty years, as they solve crimes old and new--and explore the profound mysteries of the human heart. The Buried Bride (Book 4)--With the Archbishop’s blessing, Helen and I are spending Lent building a relationship built on love--but without physical intimacy. And yes, it’s as hard as it sounds. But this penitential season, I have other work to do. I need to rebuild my relationship with the families of St. Clare’s after neglecting my duties as their shepherd. I must confess my sins to them, and ask their forgiveness. With these two tasks, I expected this Lent to be the longest of my life. But I didn’t expect to be fighting to stay out of prison. The Defining Decision (Book 5)--After the astonishing news from the Archbishop, Helen and I are looking forward to possibly having a life together as husband and wife. That is, if the Holy Father grants me permission. While awaiting word from the Vatican, we’re getting to know each other more deeply. Going out on dates, spending time together, talking about what our life together will be like if we’re allowed to marry. All of this under Anna’s watchful eye, and being very careful to keep things secret. But then Gladys runs over the President of Myer College’s chief of staff. What looks like a tragic accident takes a bizarre turn when drugs are found in his system. Is the young genius I consider a daughter guilty of murder, or is she being set up by someone from her past? The Silent Shooter (Book 6)--The Pope’s decision to allow us to marry captures the imagination of the entire world. Finally, after having to hide our relationship from all but a few close friends, we can openly proclaim our love for each other, and celebrate with our parish family our future lives together. But not everyone, it seems, is happy with our plans. First come the letters, threatening Helen with divine justice if she persists in her plans. Then, on live television, someone takes a shot at us. It soon becomes apparent that someone’s decided to stop us at any cost. But Helen already knows who wants her dead. It’s someone from her past as a Detective in Washington, D.C. A serial killer who sees himself acting as God’s instrument to kill impure women. With little to go on besides the letters of a lunatic and a possible connection between the killer and a fanatic priest with his own agenda, we’re in a race against time to find a killer--before the killer finds us first.

Take this family adventure and discover intrigue, heroism, and--most of all—epic love. Craving HEAT by Adrienne Giordano - Maggie Kingston is a woman working in a man’s world…and doing a damn good job. Being Steele Ridge’s first female sheriff isn’t easy. Especially when your cousins are magnets for trouble. The Steeles do everything the hard way, but Maggie’s tougher than she looks. Nothing shakes this sheriff until her cousin brings one of his superstar players—and the accompanying media circus—to town. The press can’t get enough of the sexy quarterback. And neither can Maggie… Jayson Tucker devoted his whole career to the New York Knights. So when the team takes a rookie’s side over his after a locker room brawl, he takes refuge from the spotlight. Except reporters aren’t the only ones after him. Someone wants Jayson benched. Permanently. When the threat becomes deadly, hiding won’t be enough. And in Steele Ridge, security comes in the luscious form of its gorgeous, no-nonsense sheriff. Jayson’s always fought his own battles. The closer he gets to Maggie, the less he’s willing to risk her being caught in the crossfire. Yet Maggie is no damsel in distress. She’s more than capable of keeping her town—and her man—safe. But can she say the same about her heart? Tasting FIRE by Kelsey Browning - Fire in one hand, ashes in the other Studious tutor Emmy McKay fell in love with Cash Kingston over a biology textbook, never expecting the high school football hero to give her a second thought. But his feelings for her burned just as hot. All too soon, Emmy’s choices destroyed their youthful relationship, reducing it to a pile of ash. Years later, she has landed her dream job as an ER doctor in her hometown. Now it’s time to win back her dream man. As a firefighter and tactical medic, Cash Kingston is no stranger to white-knuckle situations. But when he learns his beautiful—and brilliant—ex-girlfriend has returned to Steele Ridge, he feels as if he’s standing on the roof of a blazing building. With no escape route in sight. Emmy is the only woman who’s ever had the power to build him up one minute and burn him down the next. But when someone targets Emmy and they begin to suspect the danger stems from their past relationship, it’s impossible for Cash to stay detached. Will the struggle to untangle a web of half-truths bring them closer together, or will it tear them apart for good? Searing NEED by Tracey Devlyn - To escape a brutal killer, a brilliant researcher teams up with a tortured soldier who poses an even greater threat... to her heart. Her sister might be the law and her brothers the brawn, but Riley Kingston is definitely the brains of the family. She’s a talented botanist well on her way to a PhD—so why does she feel like a failure? Fired from a dream project in Costa Rica, Riley’s stuck back in her hometown. Cataloguing plants on Steele land keeps her busy, but it’s far from compelling work. Until she discovers a fascinating new specimen. One with a body made for pleasure . . . and eyes filled with a pain she longs to understand. Delta Force operator Coen Monroe doesn’t want to be studied. Not even by the sexy scientist whose inquisitive glances stir up desires he isn’t ready to handle. He came to Steele Ridge to be alone, to battle his nightmares and the memories triggering them. But Riley’s gentle seduction is as relentless as her curiosity. She soothes his wounded soul . . . and fires up his defensive instincts. But when her research sparks a deadly conspiracy, Coen is exactly what she needs. When Riley is targeted by a sociopath bent on silencing her forever, Coen will do anything to protect her. But can he save the woman he loves without losing himself in the process?

Sleepwalk’s hero, Will Bear, is a man with so many aliases that he simply thinks of himself as the Barely Blur. At fifty years old, he’s been living off the grid for over half his life. He’s never had a real job, never paid taxes, never been in a committed relationship. A good-natured henchman with a complicated and lonely past and a passion for LSD microdosing, he spends his time hopscotching across state lines in his beloved camper van, running sometimes shady often dangerous errands for a powerful and ruthless operation he’s never troubled himself to learn too much about. He has lots of connections, but no true ties. His longest relationships are with an old rescue dog that has post-traumatic stress and a childhood friend as deeply entrenched in the underworld as he is, who, lately, he’s less and less sure he can trust. Out of the blue, one of Will's many burner phones heralds a call from a twenty-year-old woman claiming to be his biological daughter. She says she’s the product of one of his long-ago sperm donations; he’s half certain she’s AI. She needs his help. She’s entrenched in a widespread and nefarious plot involving Will’s employers, and for Will to continue to have any contact with her increasingly fuzzes the line between the people he is working for and the people he’s running from. With his signature blend of haunting emotional realism and fast-paced intrigue, Dan Chaon populates his fractured America with characters who ring all too true. Gazing both back to the past and forward to an inevitable-enough-seeming future, Sleepwalk examines where we’ve been and where we’re going and the connections that bind us, no matter how far we travel to dodge them or how cleverly we hide.",

When Speedboat burst on the scene in the late ’70s it was like nothing readers had encountered before. It seemed to disregard the rules of the novel, but it wore its unconventionality with ease. Reading it was a pleasure of a new, unexpected kind. Above all, there was its voice, ambivalent, curious, wry, the voice of Jen Fain, a journalist negotiating the fraught landscape of contemporary urban America. Party guests, taxi drivers, brownstone dwellers, professors, journalists, presidents, and debutantes fill these dispatches from the world as Jen finds it. A touchstone over the years for writers as different as David Foster Wallace and Elizabeth Hardwick, Speedboat returns to enthrall a new generation of readers.",

And is the stranger all he appears to be? As Murdoch gives in to temptation and risks everything by returning to his old criminal ways, the hunt for Scott Patterson takes an unexpected turn. Soon Murdoch and his partner, Davie Simms, are dragged into a depraved underworld of human trafficking, prostitution and torture, where they will find evil on their doorstep, and face a desperate fight for their lives... _____________________________________ PRAISE FOR THE MURDOCH BOOKS: \"Gillmore is a great author and knows how to make the characters and setting really interesting\" -- Book Addict's Reviews \"A lot of the success of HEADLAND is down to the character of Bill Murdoch.

        "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of The Midnight Library. “A quirky romcom dusted with philosophical observations….A delightfully witty…poignant novel.” —The Washington Post “She smiled a soft, troubled smile and I felt the whole world slipping away, and I wanted to slip with it, to go wherever she was going… I had existed whole years without her, but that was all it had been. An existence. A book with no words.” Tom Hazard has just moved back to London, his old home, to settle down and become a high school history teacher. And on his first day at school, he meets a captivating French teacher at his school who seems fascinated by him. But Tom has a dangerous secret. He may look like an ordinary 41-year-old, but owing to a rare condition, he's been alive for centuries. Tom has lived history--performing with Shakespeare, exploring the high seas with Captain Cook, and sharing cocktails with Fitzgerald. Now, he just wants an ordinary life. Unfortunately for Tom, the Albatross Society, the secretive group which protects people like Tom, has one rule: Never fall in love. As painful memories of his past and the erratic behavior of the Society's watchful leader threaten to derail his new life and romance, the one thing he can't have just happens to be the one thing that might save him. Tom will have to decide once and for all whether to remain stuck in the past, or finally begin living in the present. How to Stop Time tells a love story across the ages—and for the ages—about a man lost in time, the woman who could save him, and the lifetimes it can take to learn how to live. It is a bighearted, wildly original novel about losing and finding yourself, the inevitability of change, and how with enough time to learn, we just might find happiness.

Yeah, that’s not me. I’m a barber to the supernatural because my magic is too weak and weird to do anything else. So why have the fae asked me to look after one of their eggs—the most precious thing in the world to a fae—when I’m so vastly under qualified? Either they’ve taken leave of their senses, or they’re seriously desperate. And if the fae are desperate, that means that with my weak magic, I’m utterly out of my depth. Oh, and my backup is a sarcastic cat, which doesn’t come in handy when I find myself facing off against a very old, very powerful magical creature who’s after the egg. The damn cat scampers off and I’m left with nothing more than my piddly magic and my wits to get myself out of this mess. That’s the thing about the magical underworld of Panong—it might be dangerous and complicated, but at least it’s never dull. The Razor’s Edge Chronicles is an Asian Urban Fantasy series drawing inspiration from various Asian myths and featuring all kind of amazing new magical creatures, totally different from anything you’ve encountered so far.

        "description": "A Study in Scarlet, detective novel by Conan Doyle, written in 1886, the story marks the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who would become two of the most famous characters in popular fiction. The book's title derives from a speech given by Holmes, an amateur detective, to his friend and chronicler Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story's murder investigation as his \"study in scarlet\": \"There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.\" The story, and its main characters, attracted little public interest when it first appeared. Only 11 complete copies of the magazine in which the story first appeared, Beeton's Christmas Annual for 1887, are known to exist now and they have considerable value. Although Conan Doyle wrote 56 short stories featuring Holmes, A Study in Scarlet is one of only four full-length novels in the original canon. The novel was followed by The Sign of the Four, published in 1890. A Study in Scarlet was the first work of detective fiction to incorporate the magnifying glass as an investigative tool.",

Thirteen times it has been vandalized, dismantled, or stolen. Why? What secrets does it hold? Enter UNESCO investigator, Nicholas Lee, who works for the United Nations’ Cultural Liaison and Investigative Office (CLIO). Nick’s job is to protect the world’s cultural artifacts—anything and everything from countless lesser-known objects to national treasures. When Nick travels to Belgium for a visit with a woman from his past, he unwittingly stumbles on the trail of a legendary panel from the Ghent Altarpiece, stolen in 1934 under cover of night and never seen since. Soon Nick is plunged into a bitter conflict, one that has been simmering for nearly two thousand years. On one side is the Maidens of Saint-Michael, les Vautours—the Vultures—a secret order of nuns and the guardians of a great truth. Pitted against them is the Vatican, which has wanted for centuries to both find and possess what the nuns guard. Because of Nick the maidens have finally been exposed, their secret placed in dire jeopardy—a vulnerability that the Vatican swiftly moves to exploit utilizing an ambitious cardinal and a corrupt archbishop, both with agendas of their own. From the tranquil canals of Ghent, to the towering bastions of Carcassonne, and finally into an ancient abbey high in the French Pyrenees, Nick Lee must confront a modern-day religious crusade intent on eliminating a shocking truth from humanity’s past. Success or failure—life and death—all turn on the Omega Factor.",

Seaside' came about firstly because I was commissioned to write a story for the World Horror Convention souvenir book and, as the event was to take place in Brighton, it seemed logical to set a tale on the South coast of England. \"I had written a fantasy novel, Calabash, some years earlier, hinting at the dark madness of such seaside towns, which are the antithesis of their Mediterranean counterparts. I thought of the depressing Morrissey song \"Every Day is Like Sunday\", which captures the awfulness of English resorts. \"Coincidentally, Kim Newman and I were discussing the inherent creepiness of pantomime dames, and I decided it was time to give vent to my horror of these coastal pleasure domes. I wish I'd thought to include screaming gangs of hen-nighters as well. And I thought it was a nice touch to have everyone in the story telling the hero to 'fuck off' until he finally does.\" Featherweight - Robert Shearman \"I don't like writing at home much,\" admits the author. \"Home is a place for sleeping and eating and watching afternoon game shows on TV. There are too many distractions. So, years ago, I decided I'd only write first drafts in art galleries. \"And the best of them all is the National Gallery, in London, a pigeon's throw from Nelson's Column. I can walk around there with my notebook, thinking up stories - and if I get bored, there are lots of expensive pictures to look at. Perfect. \"A lot of those paintings, however, have angels in them. They're all over the place, wings raised, halos gleaming - perching on clouds, blowing trumpets, hovering around the Virgin Mary as if they're her strange naked childlike bodyguards. And I began to notice. That, whenever the writing is going well, the angels seemed happy, and would smile at me. And whenever the words weren't coming out right, when I felt sluggish, when I thought I'd rather take off and get myself a beer, they'd start to glare. \"I wrote this story in the National Gallery. Accompanied by a lot of glaring angels. Enjoy.\" Lesser Demons - Norman Partridge \"I was surprised to receive an invitation for S.T. Joshi's Black Wings,\" reveals Partridge, \"an anthology of Lovecraftian fiction. Although I knew S.T. admired my work, I've never quite seen myself as a Mythos writer. \"While I respect H.P. Lovecraft and his contribution to horror, I've never felt that his worldview (or maybe I should say universeview) meshed with mine. \"In the end, that's what made the story work . . . at least for me. I concentrated on my differences with Lovecraft, and approached the material from a place where Jim Thompson would be more comfortable than HPL. And I'm delighted that so many people have enjoyed the tale - it was a lot of fun to write.\"",

Book one: The Perfect Debutante Sweet-natured Miss Louella Rose looks to be a model debutante — but when she's arranged to marry Cameron, Marquess of Stanton, she can no longer hide the secret she's been keeping. Can their new love help her heal? An emotional historical romance. Book two: The Perfect Spinster Flirtatious attractions threaten to erupt in passion, but duty and honor forbid anything more. OLIVIA labors under no misapprehension that anything other than spinsterhood lies in her future because of one tiny flaw.... one might even call it... a curse. Until, that is, she falls for the charming but unattainable, Lord Kingsley. KINGSLEY is irresistibly intrigued by the Miss Olivia Redfield, and delights himself in their mutual provocation. In no position to promise more than a dalliance, Gabriel takes the unprecedented step of befriending a woman. Book three: The Perfect Christmas Miss Eliza Cline, a vicar's sister, has accepted her life as a quiet industrious spinster. Lord Crestwood, the dashing widowed baron, is the rogue from her past. A chance meeting at a Christmas House party presents a second chance for both of them. But Eliza must decide: has the Baron's unforgivable sin already doomed their love forever? This is a story about forgiveness. Over the course of a lifetime, a person is faced with millions of choices, some more difficult than others. And sometimes, we make the wrong ones. Book four: The Perfect Arrangement His father died before turning forty. His older brother, the original heir, turned up his toes at the age of two and thirty. And this year, his last remaining brother--and the spare--was suddenly killed in a duel. Circumstances aren't looking good for this second spare turned heir. The new duke of Warwick needs a son... And quickly! Lady Lillian has learned that men are not to be trusted--particularly dukes. So when the very handsome but dying \"Mister\" Masterson offers her an opportunity for lifelong independence, it seems to be the perfect arrangement. And it would have been perfect... If only she hadn't gone and fallen in love with him.",

        "description": "This thrilling conclusion to the Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman trilogy recounts the climactic events of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice from its enigmatic hero’s point of view. One of the most beloved romantic heroes in all of literature, Fitzwilliam Darcy remains an enigma even to Jane Austen’s most devoted fans. But with this concluding volume in the Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman trilogy, novelist and Austen aficionada Pamela Aidan at last gives readers the man in full. These Three Remain follows a humbled Darcy on the journey of self-discovery after Elizabeth Bennet’s rejection of his marriage proposal, in which he endeavors to grow into the kind of gentleman he’s always dreamed of being. Happily, a chance meeting with Elizabeth during a tour of his estate in Derbyshire offers Darcy a new opportunity to press his suit, but his newfound strengths are put to the test by an old nemesis, George Wickham. Vividly capturing the colorful historical and political milieu of the Regency era, Aidan writes in a style evocative of her literary progenitor, but with a wit and humor very much her own. While staying faithful to the people and events in Austen’s original, she adds her own fascinating cast of characters, weaving a rich tapestry out of Darcy’s past and present that will beguile his admirers anew.",

Someone is out to ruin Lucas and Sloan becomes a target merely because the person behind it all can see that Lucas is looking at Sloan with more than a little interest. Kidnappings, attempted murders, and more come between to two as they grasp at having some sort of a relationship. The odds are against them. Then the unimaginable occurs and love is found beyond the lust they share. Can this couple find the happiness that is evading them?

Tomorrow you will wake up in downtown Somewhere. It doesn’t matter. All the skylines look the same. Time is only marked by events. The world is on a first-name basis with you. But you…you barely even know yourself. There are those who give in completely to the idea of what it means to be famous. And those who can’t ever seem to leave the past behind. Life is a deep and contemplative story stuck on repeat—love, loss, self-destruction, self-discovery. If you could go back to the way things were before you made it…would everything still be gray?",

How long can she maintain her resolve? ***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only*** This complete set contains Books 1 to 4 Book 1 - Love Deceived Adalia Montclair has never taken a hand out in her life. She’s worked her way up and is a not-so-successful business owner following her dream of running her own bakery. Everything is going just fine, until sexy white billionaire, Trent Dawson, appears on the scene to woo her with his money, charm and blatant disregard for her insistence that she doesn’t need a man to help her. But a surprise visit throws everything into disarray when Trent shows the side of himself she’d feared he possessed all along. Book 2 - Love Forgiven Adalia is broken after a keen betrayal and the loss of her lifelong dream: her very own bakery. But she has to carry on, especially now that she’s back living under her father’s roof and has her semi-abusive ex-boyfriend’s advances to contend with. She’s determined to continue baking, even if she has to work at the local market for the rest of her days, but she can’t shake thoughts of Trent and what happened between them. Adalia has never been one to take handouts, but her father’s dire financial situation isn’t getting any better. Book 3 - Love Endured Adalia Montclair is determined to be more than Mrs. Dawson. She’s going to start her own catering business. But a surprise pregnancy throws a wrench in the works, in the form of her new husband himself. Trent is determined to keep Adalia safe, even if it means keeping her at home and away from her dreams, a fate she can’t abide, even with a baby on board. Still, even with tension growing, Adalia can’t keep her eyes or hands off her husband. The balance between work and love isn’t easy, and tipping the scales in the wrong direction may mean the end of their marriage, before it’s truly begun. Book 4 - Love Everlasting Adalia has just received the worst news of her entire life… news so bad, it threatens to tear apart her marriage if not her soul. Her son, Isaac, is gravely ill, and the only way to save him is a revolutionary treatment which will cost a lot of money. But a lot of money is exactly what Trent doesn’t have, now that Space Inc. has gone under because of the space shuttle malfunction which killed the crew onboard. He is wrapped up in litigation and has to lean on Adalia’s brother for help. Without the money, Isaac’s condition will only worsen, and it’s up to Adalia and Trent to find a way to save him. She’s determined to save her child, but the harder she tries, the more she neglects her marriage, and the more difficult it becomes to keep her head above water. Just when she thinks they’ve found a way to solve all their problems, a visit to Doctor Matheson and his oncological specialist, drives the couple into a deeper state of despair. Time is running out and only by working together can Adalia and Trent save their son. Download the complete box set to read the entire story.",

She didn't expect to be greeted by not one, but five of the most ruggedly delicious-looking men she'd ever seen. Not to mention a live cougar guarding the shop. Eldest brother Axel agrees to guide Dakota on her mountain trek. In cougar form, Axel's twin, Gunnar, was there as a protection from predators—but he had his eye on the sexy client instead. While the rule with clients was \"paws-off,\" both Axel and Gunnar couldn't resist Dakota's seductive Native American beauty and determination. As cold days led to hot nights in the cabin, Axel and Gunnar wondered if they'd finally found a woman strong enough to tame them… FALKE'S CAPTIVE A Puma Shifter Ménage Romance A graduate student working in animal genetics, Beth Coldwell is in town to track and tag big cats in the wild.

When Kelan, in cougar form, is captured, that secret comes closer than ever to being revealed. He escapes, but not before Beth draws a blood sample, and analysis shows this is no ordinary mountain lion. Kelan and Reidar cannot deny the powerful attraction they feel toward Beth.

Javier made a vow never to mate again after his loss…but if he wants to keep Heidi in his life, he'll have to decide how far he'll go for vengeance.",

Remember: With a Vanessa Vale book, one cowboy is never enough. In this smokin' hot series, each heroine gets an extra helping (or two) of Grade-A Beefcake.",

        "description": "Here is the story of David as you have never heard it before: from the king himself, telling the unofficial version, the one he never allowed his court scribes to recount. Rooted in ancient lore, his is a surprisingly modern memoir. Notorious for his contradictions, David is seen by others as a gifted court entertainer, a successful captain in Saul’s army, a cunning fugitive, a traitor leading a gang of felons, and a ruthless raider of neighboring towns who leaves no witnesses behind. But how does he see himself, during this first phase of his life? With his hands stained with blood, can he find an inner balance between conflicting drives: his ambition for the crown, his determination to survive the conflict with Saul, and his longing for purity, for a touch of the divine, as expressed so lyrically in his psalms? If you like ancient historical fiction about court intrigue, this king David novel has a modern twist like no book you have read before.",

Out for a bicycle ride in the hills beyond Inversgail, Janet Marsh discovers the body of Dr. Malcolm Murray. The elderly Murray and his own bicycle went off the road and down a steep slope—he’s sprawled in the burn at the bottom, his damaged bike in a patch of thistles on the bank. Janet calls the Police Scotland emergency number. Tire tracks at the side of the narrow road suggest a vehicle might have been involved. But if it was an accident, the driver hasn’t come forward. And if it wasn’t an accident. . . . But who would want the well-loved, retired doctor dead? A few days after the death, a box of vintage first editions is left on the doorstep of Yon Bonnie Books with a note: “Please look after these books. Thank you.” Janet and her crew at the shop are at first delighted, and then mystified—what exactly does “look after” mean? Are they free to sell them? And what are the odd notes penciled in the margins? With a little digging, the women decide the books might belong to Malcolm Murray or his reclusive brother, Gerald. When Janet and Christine call at Malcolm’s house, they find his confused, angry sister and evidence of a burglary. When they go to Gerald’s modest croft house, they find the door ajar and Gerald dead inside, stabbed with a regimental dagger. While the police try to determine if the Murray brothers’ deaths are connected and who’s responsible, Janet and the bookshop owners try to find out how and why the box of books ended up on their doorstep. The police are interested in those questions, too, and they’re more than a little suspicious. Are the Yon Bonnie women as good with burglar tools as they are with books—and at finding bodies?",

Years ago, bookseller and mystery aficionado Malcolm Kershaw compiled a list of the genre's most unsolvable murders, those that are almost impossible to crack--which he titled \"Eight Perfect Murders\"--chosen from among the best of the best including Agatha Christie's A. B. C. Murders, Patricia Highsmith's Strangers on a Train, Ira Levin's Death Trap, A. A. Milne's Red House Mystery, Anthony Berkeley Cox's Malice Aforethought, James M. Cain's Double Indemnity, John D. Macdonald's The Drowner, and Donna Tartt's A Secret History. But no one is more surprised than Mal, now the owner of the Old Devils Bookstore in Boston, when an FBI agent comes knocking on his door one snowy day in February. She's looking for information about a series of unsolved murders that look eerily similar to the killings on Mal's old list. And the FBI agent isn't the only one interested in this bookseller who spends almost every night at home reading. There is killer is out there, watching his every move--a diabolical threat who knows way too much about Mal's personal history, especially the secrets he's never told anyone, even his recently deceased wife. To protect himself, Mal begins looking into possible suspects . . . and sees a killer in everyone around him. But Mal doesn't count on the investigation leaving a trail of death in its wake. Suddenly, a series of shocking twists leaves more victims dead--and the noose around Mal's neck grows so tight he might never escape.",

        "description": "Ebenezer Le Page, cantankerous, opinionated, and charming, is one of the most compelling literary creations of the late twentieth century. Eighty years old, Ebenezer has lived his whole life on the Channel Island of Guernsey, a stony speck of a place caught between the coasts of England and France yet a world apart from either. Ebenezer himself is fiercely independent, but as he reaches the end of his life he is determined to tell his own story and the stories of those he has known. He writes of family secrets and feuds, unforgettable friendships and friendships betrayed, love glimpsed and lost. The Book of Ebenezer Le Page is a beautifully detailed chronicle of a life, but it is equally an oblique reckoning with the traumas of the twentieth century, as Ebenezer recalls both the men lost to the Great War and the German Occupation of Guernsey during World War II, and looks with despair at the encroachments of commerce and tourism on his beloved island. G. B. Edwards labored in obscurity all his life and completed The Book of Ebenezer Le Page shortly before his death. Published posthumously, the book is a triumph of the storyteller’s art that conjures up the extraordinary voice of a living man. \"Imagine a weekend spent in deep conversation with a superb old man, a crusty, intelligent, passionate and individualistic character at the peak of his powers as a raconteur, and you will have a very good ideas of the impact of The Book of Ebenezer Le Page...It amuses, it entertains, it moves us...” –The Washington Post \"A true epic, as sexy as it is hilarious, it seems drenched with the harsh tidal beauties of its setting...For every person nearing retirement, every latent writer who hopes to leave his island and find the literary mainland, its author–quiet, self-sufficient, tidy Homeric–remains a patron saint.\" –Allan Gurganus, O Magazine",

But when a brutal killer starts claiming the lives of the town's most attractive women, lifelong neighbors are forced to wonder if the culprit is a stranger lurking in the bayou...or someone right next door. Burned out by a whirlwind career, world-famous concert violinist Caroline Waverly arrives in Innocence looking for a little peace and some time to think. She hopes that a stay at her late grandmother's house--the one with a covered porch just made for soft summer nights--will provide the tranquillity she needs. But Innocence has something else to offer Caroline: handsome, charming Tucker Longstreet. Tucker is known for keeping his romances short and shallow. But one look at Caroline, and Tucker realizes that she is unlike any other woman he's met. The coolly reserved Caroline feels an unexpected thrill at his ardent advances. But when she discovers a third murder victim in the murky waters behind her home, her summer liaison threatens to become much more. Because there's just one small problem with her new romance: Tucker is the leading suspect in the killings.",

        "description": "The great Japanese author’s most famous novel, in its first new English translation in half a century No collection of Japanese literature is complete without Natsume Soseki's Kokoro, his most famous novel and the last he completed before his death. Published here in the first new translation in more than fifty years, Kokoro—meaning \"heart\"—is the story of a subtle and poignant friendship between two unnamed characters, a young man and an enigmatic elder whom he calls \"Sensei.\" Haunted by tragic secrets that have cast a long shadow over his life, Sensei slowly opens up to his young disciple, confessing indiscretions from his own student days that have left him reeling with guilt, and revealing, in the seemingly unbridgeable chasm between his moral anguish and his student's struggle to understand it, the profound cultural shift from one generation to the next that characterized Japan in the early twentieth century.",

        "description": "“A big, sprawling saga of a novel” (San Francisco Chronicle), this epic family drama is a masterwork by the revered author of The Great Santini. Pat Conroy’s classic novel stings with honesty and resounds with drama. Spanning forty years, it’s the story of turbulent Tom Wingo, his gifted and troubled twin sister, Savannah, and their struggle to triumph over the dark and tragic legacy of the extraordinary family into which they were born. Filled with the vanishing beauty of the South Carolina Low Country as well as the dusty glitter of New York City, The Prince of Tides showcases an American original at his very best. Praise for The Prince of Tides “This is a powerful book. . . . [Pat] Conroy is a master of language.”—The Atlanta Journal “A big, sprawling saga of a novel . . . the kind you can hole up with and spend some days with and put down feeling that you’ve emerged from a terrible, wonderful spell.”—San Francisco Chronicle “A literary gem . . . The Prince of Tides is in the best tradition of novel writing. It is an engrossing story of unforgettable characters.”—The Pittsburgh Press “A masterpiece.”—Detroit Free Press “Brilliant.”—Chicago Tribune",

        "description": "A dazzling collection of short stories from renowned writer Richard Burgin. Five-time Pushcart Prize winner Richard Burgin’s stories have been praised by the New York Times Book Review as “eerily funny, dexterous, and too haunting to be easily forgotten,” with “characters of such variety that no generalizations about them can apply.” In Don’t Think, his ninth collection of short fiction, Burgin offers us his most daring and imaginatively varied work to date. The stories explore universal themes of love, family, and time, examining relationships and memory—both often troubled, fragmented, and pieced back together only when shared between characters. 7v6 In the title story, written in propulsive, musical prose, a divorced father struggles to cling to reality through his searing love for his highly imaginative son, who has been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. In “Of Course He Wanted to Be Remembered,” two young women meet to commemorate the death of a former college professor with whom they were both unusually close—though in very different ways. In “V.I.N.,” a charismatic drug dealer tries to gain control of a bizarre cult devoted to rethinking life’s meaning in relation to infinite time, while in “The Intruder,” an elderly art dealer befriends a homeless young woman who has been sleeping in his basement. Together, the nine stories in Don’t Think illuminate the astonishing fact of existence itself while justifying the Philadelphia Inquirer’s assessment that Burgin is one of America’s most distinctive storytellers.",

Now Fetchen and his gang are racing the Sackett brothers to Colorado—leaving behind a trail of betrayal, robbery, and murder. Flagan and Galloway can only guess why Judith is so important to Fetchen and what awaits them at her father’s ranch. One thing Flagan knows for sure: The tough and spirited woman has won his heart.

But when it happens, she feels powerless to stop him, or the course of events that follow Brad’s departure. Jane finds an old ring in a box of relics from a British jumble sale and discovers a Latin inscription in the band along with just one recognizable word: Jane. Feeling an instant connection to the mysterious ring bearing her namesake, Jane begins a journey to learn more about the ring—and perhaps about herself. ~ In the sixteenth-century, Lucy Day becomes the dressmaker to Lady Jane Grey, an innocent young woman whose fate seems to be controlled by a dangerous political and religious climate, one threatening to deny her true love and pursuit of her own interests. As the stories of both Janes dovetail through the journey of one ring, it becomes clear that each woman has far more influence over her life than she once imagined.

Simenon was unequaled at making us look inside, though the ability was masked by his brilliance at absorbing us obsessively in his stories.” —The Guardian When a Paris musician witnesses an altercation that may have been a murder, the young Inspector Maigret becomes embroiled in his first case A musician walking home along the Rue Chaptal in the early hours of the morning sees a panic-stricken woman call for help from an upstairs window; moments later he hears a gun shot. He tries to go to her assistance, pushing past the man who opens the door upon his frantic knocking, but he finds himself roughly ejected from the premises. Undeterred, he heads for the nearest police station and urges Maigret to return with him and find out what has taken place. With this look into the man he once was and how he became the insightful inspector we have some to know, Simenon offers new insights into the brilliance of Maigret.",

That’s when they came across an old Irish trader who offered them two fine horses if they would agree to escort his granddaughter, Judith, to her father in Colorado. Flagan saw nothing but trouble in the fiery young woman, but they needed the horses. Unfortunately, Flagan was right, for Judith had fallen for James Black Fetchen, a charismatic gunman whose courtship hid the darkest of intentions. Now Fetchen and his gang are racing the Sackett brothers to Colorado—leaving behind a trail of betrayal, robbery, and murder. Flagan and Galloway can only guess why Judith is so important to Fetchen and what awaits them at her father’s ranch. One thing Flagan knows for sure: The tough and spirited woman has won his heart. But can he trust her with his life?",

Billy Bryan soon realizes that this place and his past remain as star-crossed as when he played winter ball in the Cuban capital decades before. Against his better judgment, Billy becomes entangled in a scheme to spirit a top baseball prospect off the island. This pits him against his old friend Fidel Castro. Despite being in his final days, the dictator remains a dangerous adversary, as does the Cuban sports machine and the Mexican crime syndicates that now direct baseball talent toward the U.S. Major Leagues. In Escape from Castro’s Cuba, Billy must once again navigate the crosscurrents of the so-called City of Columns: a place where the sunsets from the Hotel Nacional along the Malecón breakwater are as beautiful as ever, but where the alleyways in Old Havana still fan out, crooked and broken, like an old catcher’s fingers.",

        "description": "A collection of classic, fantastical tales from Northern Japan that are equal parts whimsical and sophisticated, perfect for readers of all ages. Kenji Miyazawa is one of modern Japan’s most beloved writers, a great poet and a strange and marvelous spinner of tales, whose sly, humorous, enchanting, and enigmatic stories bear a certain resemblance to those of his contemporary Robert Walser. John Bester’s selection and expert translation of Miyazawa’s short fiction reflects its full range from the joyful, innocent “Wildcat and the Acorns,” to the cautionary tale “The Restaurant of Many Orders,” to “The Earthgod and the Fox,” which starts out whimsically before taking a tragic turn. Miyazawa also had a deep connection to Japanese folklore and an intense love of the natural world. In “The Wild Pear,” what seem to be two slight nature sketches succeed in encapsulating some of the cruelty and compensations of life itself.",

The author of A Man Called Ove returns with “a lyrical look at how a community heals, how families recover, and how individuals grow” (The Washington Post). “Fans of Backman will not be disappointed. His work continues to amaze and captivate, enlighten and thrill.” —Shelf Awareness A small community tucked deep in the forest, Beartown is home to tough, hardworking people who don’t expect life to be easy or fair. No matter how difficult times get, they’ve always been able to take pride in their local ice hockey team. So it’s a cruel blow when they hear that their town’s ice hockey club might soon be disbanded. What makes it worse is the obvious satisfaction that all the former Beartown players, who now play for a rival team in the neighboring town of Hed, take in that fact. But the arrival of a newcomer gives Beartown hockey a chance at a comeback. Soon a team starts to take shape around Amat, the fastest player you’ll ever see; Benji, the intense lone wolf; always dutiful and eager-to-please Bobo; and Vidar, a born-to-be-bad troublemaker. But bringing this team together proves to be a huge challenge, especially as the town’s enmity with Hed grows more and more acute as the big game approaches. By the time the last goal is scored, a resident of Beartown will be dead, and the people of both towns will be forced to wonder if, after everything, the game they love can ever return to something as simple and innocent as a field of ice, two nets, and two teams. Us against you. Here is a declaration of love for all the big and small, bright and dark stories that give form and color to our communities. With immense compassion and insight, Fredrik Backman reveals how loyalty, friendship, and kindness can carry a town through its most challenging days.",

Feeling an instant connection to the mysterious ring bearing her namesake, Jane begins a journey to learn more about the ring—and perhaps about herself. ~ In the sixteenth-century, Lucy Day becomes the dressmaker to Lady Jane Grey, an innocent young woman whose fate seems to be controlled by a dangerous political and religious climate, one threatening to deny her true love and pursuit of her own interests. As the stories of both Janes dovetail through the journey of one ring, it becomes clear that each woman has far more influence over her life than she once imagined. It all comes down to the choices each makes despite the realities they face.",

An apocalyptic tale of this planet’s ultimate fate, it features a midget as the protagonist, a complete, original theology created by a calypso singer, and a vision of the future that is at once blackly fatalistic and hilariously funny. A book that left an indelible mark on an entire generation of readers, Cat’s Cradle is one of the twentieth century’s most important works—and Vonnegut at his very best. “[Vonnegut is] an unimitative and inimitable social satirist.”—Harper’s Magazine “Our finest black-humorist . . .

In “Man from the Sky,” Paul Torridon and his plainsman guide ride together on their way to Fort Kendry. But one morning the guide has vanished without a trace, and Paul is left with just his faithful steed. Paul knows that his destination will be near impossible to find without a guide, and that’s only if he and his horse make it out of the barren plains alive. But just as it looks like Paul’s luck has finally run out, he stumbles upon an ailing Cheyenne warrior sprawled on a small island in a dry gulch . . . The title story opens with renowned gunman Hank Peyton on his deathbed. Hank tells his son Jerry that he’ll be leaving him his legendary gun, known as The Voice of La Paloma. But Jerry soon falls on tough times and becomes easy prey for the corrupt sheriff and his posse, who accuse him of stealing horses. When the real horse thief is discovered, instead of clearing Jerry’s name the sheriff makes a deal with the outlaw: steal The Voice of Paloma, and the crime will be forgiven! Peyton collects two of legendary Western author Max Brand’s most exciting stories in one volume, showcasing a master of his craft at work.

Filled with twisting plots, unforgettable flesh-and-blood characters, and absorbing dramatic tension, her previous national bestsellers have propelled her into the top ranks of legal suspense. Now, this acclaimed author is back with Mistaken Identity, her most thoughtful, riveting, and richest novel yet. Life holds few surprises for Bennie Rosato, head of her own Philadelphia law firm. As a criminal attorney now specializing in police misconduct cases, she's seen the noblest and most deviant aspects of human nature. But nothing can prepare her for the moment she enters a maximum-security prison to meet her new client, Alice Connolly, face to face. Accused of brutally murdering her lover, a highly decorated police detective, Connolly claims the police framed her. A defendant protesting her innocence is not unusual for Bennie. What shocks her is that Connelly bears an uncanny physical resemblance to her. \"Pleased to meet you. I'm your twin. Your identical twin,\" Connolly tells the astonished lawyer. But Bennie grew up as an only child, or so she thought. She has a law firm, a handsome young lover, and a golden retriever; she doesn't have a twin. Or does she? Connolly knows too many intimate details about Bennie's life and family for the resemblance to be just coincidental. And there is something about the woman that compels the intrigued attorney to defend her, against her better judgment. Taking the case with the trial only a week away, Bennie plunges into the mystery of the murder, as well as her own identity and her family's dark secrets. Is Connolly innocent? And is she Bennie's unknown sister? It is not until Bennie takes the case to verdict that she will finally learn the truth, which threatens to change her life. A legal thriller, a courtroom drama, and an exploration of the emotional bonds that define our lives and those we love, Mistaken Identity is a masterful achievement that takes the legal thriller to a new level as it resoundingly confirms Lisa Scottoline's place as one of the premier writers of suspense fiction today.",

First published in Weird Tales in the early 1930s, C.L. Moore’s Northwest Smith stories, especially “Shambleau,” were hailed as some of the most imaginative and vivid science fiction stories ever to come out of the golden age of sci-fi. At a time when women were heavily underrepresented in the genre, Moore was among the first to gain critical and popular acclaim, and decades later was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. Northwest Smith, now recognized by many as the archetypal space smuggler and gunslinger, is an adventurer in the classic sense of the word, and these thirteen stories chronicle the bizarre dangers, interstellar wonders, and titillating romances that captured the imagination of a generation.",

        "description": "\"You knew they were there, didn't you?\" Kahlan asked in a hushed tone as she leaned closer. Against the darkening sky, she could just make out the shapes of three black-tipped races taking to wing, beginning their nightly hunt. That was why he'd stopped. That was what he'd been watching as the rest of them waited in uneasy silence. \"Yes,\" Richard said. He gestured over his shoulder without turning to look. \"There are two more, back there.\" Kahlan briefly scanned the dark jumble of rock, but she didn't see any others. Lightly grasping the silver pommel with two fingers, Richard lifted his sword a few inches, checking that it was clear in its scabbard. A last, fleeting glimmer of amber light played across his golden cape as he let the sword drop back in place. In the gathering gloom of dusk, his familiar, tall, powerful contour seemed as if it were no more than an apparition made of shadows. Just then, two more of the huge birds shot by right overhead. One, wings stretched wide, let out a piercing scream as it banked into a tight gliding turn, circling once more in assessment of the five people below before stroking its powerful wings to catch its departing comrades in their swift journey west. This night they would find ample food.",

        "description": "An eagerly awaited collection of stories dealing with domestic abuse, edited by the New York Times bestselling author Zane. Breaking the Cycle is a stunning and moving anthology of stories, each of which focuses on an aspect of domestic abuse. This powerful collection is sure to serve as a wake-up call for people either dealing with a domestic abuse situation, or those watching someone else endure it. In the title story, Zane describes the turmoil that a young girl suffers at the hands of her stepfather. The girl and her mother plan their escape, but at the last minute the mother falters. In D.V. Bernard's \"The Lonely Echoes of My Youth,\" readers are introduced to a young boy raising himself on the fringes of a drug-infested neigborhood. Nane Quartay's provocative story, \"The Grindstone,\" describes a boy who witnesses a brutal murder which will have far-reaching effects on him and his family. Tracy Price-Thompson weaves a powerful tale in \"The Stranger\" when a woman constantly abused by her husband finds inner strength after a brutal attack. Collen Dixon's \"The Break of Dawn\" will keep readers deep in thought long after they finish reading her story about a young desperate mother terrifed that her own daughter will grow up and become victimized herself. Dywane D. Birch's \"Victory Begins With Me\" reflects how one woman has to struggle to get her life back to normal. Shonda Cheekes' \"Silent Suffering\" flips the script when a man finds himself abused by the female in his life. Newcomer J.L. Woodson's \"God Does Answer Prayers\" deals with a young boy fighting for his life in a hospital bed, put there by one of the people who is supposed to love him the most: a parent. These stories capture the dangerous realities of domestic abuse, while also pointing toward the steps that need to be taken to break the cycle that perpetuates it. It is sure to serve as a rallying cry for all those who desire victory over their own victimization, and a guide for understanding the complex undercurrents that make such patterns possible.",
